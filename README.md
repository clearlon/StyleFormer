# StyleMixFormer for Instagram Filter Removal

# Description
The official implementation of the User clearlon On the [AIM 2022 Instagram Filter Removal Challenge](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/5081#results). We propose a method for removing Instagram filters from the images by assuming the affects of filters as the style information.

# Dataset
[IFFI dataset](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/5081#participate) contains high-resolution (1080Ã—1080) 600 images and with 16 different filtered versions for each. In particular, we have picked mostly-used 16 filters: 1977, Amaro, Brannan, Clarendon, Gingham, He-Fe, Hudson, Lo-Fi, Mayfair, Nashville, Perpetua, Sutro, Toaster, Valencia, ~~Willow~~, X-Pro II.
